								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the challenges of undertaking international cultural heritage projects is that each new working environment invariably offers unique, expected surprises in the course of implementation. As a project manager, detailed organization, a long spreadsheet, expert advice, and a little luck help me navigate these provocations. At the Digital Library of the Middle East (DLME), lessons are emerging with our overseas work, including one piece of advice offered by a colleague that I will remember each time I work overseas.</p>
<p>In April 2019, I was invited to Erbil, the capital of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, for a workshop on the Protection and Conservation of the Cultural Heritage of Communities Affected by ISIS in Iraq, offered by the Smithsonian Institution at the Iraqi Institute for the Conservation of Antiquities and Heritage. During that visit, I traveled with my colleague, librarian Amed Demirhan, to the city of Sulaimani to meet with representatives of the</p>

<p>Kurdish Heritage Institute (KHI). The KHI has an unmatched collection of Kurdish cultural materials that embody the story of the Kurdish people in their own language, including books, audio, and video recordings. That meeting with their director, Mazhar Khaleghi, led to an application to the US Embassy in Baghdad for a grant to support the digitization the collections of the KHI as a collaborative project with the DLME. We were honored when chosen for the funding to work with the KHI as a service provider to help fulfill its priorities.</p>
<p>All of us associated with the DLME and CLIR felt invigorated; we would tackle an on-the-ground project that would help secure the collections of the KHI and provide digital records of their legacy. This was phase one of an effort we proposed to create the first e-book lending library in Iraq, providing access to Kurdish heritage materials to interested parties around the globe. To do that, as stipulated in the grant, we had to procure equipment, train the KHI staff, establish a metadata scheme, and digitize some 10,000 books.</p>
<p>Amed Demirhan and I are the co-project directors of the digitization of the KHI’s collection. We met in Erbil and at the KHI in Sulaimani September 7–14 to implement these goals, with immediate tasks to acquire computer equipment, import a Zeutschel high-speed scanner from its manufacturer in Germany, meet with our grant officers at the American Consulate in Erbil, and visit the KHI in Sulaimani, in Kurdistan near the border with Iran, to deliver equipment and train the staff in digitization and data management.</p>

<p>We made several salient and extensible decisions, worth adopting for other hardy cultural heritage preservationists. Andy Vaughn of the American Schools of Oriental Research and Michael Danti of the University of Pennsylvania Museum, both veterans of on-the-ground work in Iraq, recommended acquiring gear in country. We bought the computer equipment, a tabletop scanner, and associated equipment in Erbil at Digital City in the Family Mall, a place that Amed knew and trusted. Digital City had a decent variety of laptops, external drives, and a desktop we needed to pair with the Zeutschel scanner. We could avoid the import hassle, the prices were similar to those in the States, and we would have a local warranty.</p>
<p>The imported Zeutschel scanner was a different story. It was fabricated in Germany and required special delivery. After a series of delays and questions regarding specifications, we finally found a reliable airfreight service in Sulaimani that organized transportation from the factory in Tübingen to the KHI. The scanner arrived just in time.</p>

<p>Our meeting with the State Department grant officers in Erbil went very well and we made a plan to return to Kurdistan with CLIR President Charles Henry in January. In Sulaimani, we consulted with Mr. Mazhar, the KHI director, on our plans and sought his input on the project; delivered and set up equipment; and met with our first-rate team of technicians from the staff of the KHI. Amed, a former university librarian at the University of Kurdistan and the American University in Nigeria, trained our colleagues on inventory, digitization, data management, and other professional issues. These conversations and interactions were principally conducted in Kurdish. My lack of immediate language understanding underscores another lesson – the need for trust in your collaborators and a mutual commitment to the same mission-based goals.</p>
<p>In recent weeks we have extended staff training in equipment operation, provided for additional procedural practice, reviewed goals and workflow,</p>

<p>and refined a Kurdish OCR issue of accuracy pertaining to the scanner. We are beginning to digitize books from the collection and will soon know more about the sustained digitization rate we can expect, a critical statistic to calibrate our timeline.</p>
<p>There were of course glitches and potholes. When we went to Digital City to fetch the equipment and drive the three hours to the KHI, it wasn’t ready and the manager on duty hadn’t even heard of our order. This was resolved through several channels of communication, some more frantic than others. That minor bit of drama brings us to my final point. It comes from our colleague, Wayne Graham, the Chief Technology Officer at CLIR, who patiently listened to me talk about the details of equipment, procurement, and delivery. More than once. On challenges and uncertainty, Wayne’s last words to me before I left for Kurdistan still resonate. “Something will go wrong, Peter. And then you’ll fix it.” Excellent advice, I think, for all of us.</p>

<p>Washington, DC, August 21, 2018—The Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) has named five curatorial advisors to the Digital Library of the Middle East (DLME):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saif-al-jabri-5922613/">Saif Abdullah Al-Jabri</a>, director, Information Center, Sultan Qaboos University Library, Oman</li>
<li><a href="http://najwaadra.net/">Najwa Adra</a>, anthropologist, Yemeni Intangible Cultural Heritage</li>
<li><a href="https://rbm.acrl.org/index.php/rbm/article/view/16667">Mariette Atallah</a>, head of Collection Development Department, Jafet Library, American University in Beirut</li>
<li><a href="http://www.aucegypt.edu/fac/ryderkouba">Ryder Kouba</a>, digital collections archivist, American University in Cairo</li>
<li>Mariam Zaki, information specialist/librarian and <a href="http://www.pilotlibraries.org/">PILOT</a> coordinator, Cairo Urban Resource Library (CURL) at <u><a href="http://clustercairo.org/cluster/cluster/team">Cairo Lab for Urban Studies, Training &amp; Environmental Research (CLUSTER)</a></u></li>
</ul>
<p>The curatorial advisors will help identify and prioritize records for federation during the continuing design phase of the <a href="https://www.clir.org/2018/04/clir-receives-1-12-million-to-implement-platform-and-processes-for-digital-library-of-the-middle-east/">DLME platform</a>. This expansion is expected to launch in 2020. The curatorial advisors will help ensure that the DLME includes representative records from all phases of the region’s history and all major languages, and that images are available in as many multimedia formats as possible. CLIR Distinguished Presidential Fellow <a href="https://www.clir.org/2018/05/clir-appoints-presidential-fellows-herman-pabbruwe-elizabeth-waraksa/">Elizabeth Waraksa</a> is coordinating the group’s work.</p>
<p>The DLME is envisioned as a non-proprietary, multilingual library of digital objects providing greater security for, preservation of, and access to digital surrogates of cultural heritage materials.</p>
<p>“The appointment of curatorial advisors marks a critically important phase of the DLME, a project conceived as a dynamic digital environment in service to the sustainability of and access to the cultural heritage of the Middle East,” said CLIR President Charles Henry. “These distinguished advisors will assure that DLME content, tools, and applications align with and exemplify regional priorities and aspirations.”</p>
<p>CLIR and its Digital Library Federation (DLF) program are working with technical partners at Stanford University to develop the DLME platform, with grant support from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The project builds on experience gained in developing the <a href="https://dlmenetwork.org/library">DLME prototype</a>, announced in January, which was supported with funding from the Whiting Foundation, and on regional partnership building and exploration of governance models in an earlier planning phase supported by Mellon. Among CLIR’s key collaborators are the Qatar National Library and the Antiquities Coalition.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><strong>CLIR Receives $1.12 Million to Implement Platform and Processes </strong><strong>for Digital Library of the Middle East</strong></p>
<p>Washington, DC, April 3, 2018—The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has awarded the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) $1.12 million to implement a sustainable, extensible digital library platform and set of curatorial processes to federate records relating to the cultural heritage of the Middle East.</p>
<p>CLIR and its Digital Library Federation (DLF) program will work with technical partners at Stanford University and content providers worldwide to build on the Digital Library of the Middle East (DLME) prototype and create processes to extend the DLME. The DLME is envisioned as a non-proprietary, multilingual library of digital objects providing greater security for, preservation of, and access to digital surrogates of cultural heritage materials.</p>
<p>“This critically important grant allows us to build and refine an exemplary global, federated digital library; to establish a secure, virtual environment for the preservation, access, and reuse of often-threatened elements of our cultural legacy; and to engage communities of effort and practice for the long-term sustainability of this and related projects,” said CLIR President and project co-PI Charles Henry.</p>
<p>The platform will be portable and reusable for any future digital library project, encouraging a global coherence of access to and preservation of the cultural record. The project team, led by DLME Project Director Peter Herdrich, Curatorial Lead Elizabeth Waraksa, and a data manager/project coordinator based at Stanford Libraries, will draw on best practices from other digital library projects to support cost-effective and reproducible curatorial workflows for identifying, selecting, and federating digital assets that represent both cultural materials under threat and objects housed in libraries and museums beyond conflict zones.</p>
<p>“We’re honored and humbled at the opportunity to undertake this project in service to the people whose history will be accessible and cross-searchable through the DLME,” said DLF Executive Director and co-PI Bethany Nowviskie. “A major focus of the work will be on respectful representation and close partnership with scholars, communities, and content stewards.”</p>
<p>“This generous support from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation will enable CLIR/DLF and its international partners to build platforms and processes that will facilitate rich scholarship on and in the region for years to come,” said CLIR Board Chair Kathleen Fitzpatrick.</p>
<p>The project builds on experience gained in developing the <a href="https://dlmenetwork.org/library">DLME prototype</a>, announced in January, which was supported with funding from the Whiting Foundation, and on regional partnership building and exploration of governance models in an earlier planning phase supported by Mellon. Among CLIR’s key collaborators are the Qatar National Library and the Antiquities Coalition.</p>
<p>CLIR and Stanford expect to launch the platform in 2020.</p>

<p>Washington, DC, January 31, 2018—The Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) today released a prototype proof of concept for the <a href="https://dlme.clir.org/">Digital Library of the Middle East</a> (DLME).

<p>Created with funding from the Whiting Foundation, the current <a href="https://dlmenetwork.org/library">prototype</a> includes some 135,000 objects. The DLME will ultimately encompass text, video, photographs, archives, manuscripts, 3-D data, and maps illuminating the region’s history over 12 millennia, curated by scholars, specialists, and members of the living and vital cultures it represents. The platform, developed by Stanford Libraries, allows for the display of information in Romanized or Arabic forms.</p>
<p>“A digital bridge, like the successful platform prototype of the DLME, is a multidimensional bond, bringing together many countries, people, and perspectives to collectively celebrate the preservation, access, sustainability, and wonder of our cultural heritage,” said CLIR President Charles Henry.</p>
<p>DLME partners include cultural heritage organizations worldwide who aim to contribute to a globally available resource that provides detailed descriptions and images of artifacts, along with culturally nuanced information about the objects’ history and provenance. Scholars in Cairo, school-children in California and Ankara, travelers from Buenos Aires, and customs agents fighting artifact trafficking in Singapore, among others, will benefit from access to the DLME.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through close collaborations with the stewards of the cultural heritage of the Middle East, the DLME aspires to bring the full richness of that long history to students, teachers, scholars, and citizens throughout the region and around the world,” said Daniel Reid, executive director of the Whiting Foundation. “This proof-of-concept has been a crucial first step in building the technical infrastructure and beginning to establish the many partnerships necessary to achieve this important ambition.&#8221;</p>
<p>“The intellectual leadership of our regional partners is essential to the project’s success,” said Peter Herdrich, co-founder of the Antiquities Coalition and a principal investigator on the grant project. “The UN calls inventory creation, digitization, and access a first step in protecting cultural heritage collections from looting and illicit trafficking and that’s exactly what we intend to collaborate on.”</p>
<p>“Cultural preservation through digitization and widespread access to information about the Middle East region have never been more important. The DLME will play a fundamental role in raising awareness and advancing understanding of the MENA region’s cultural heritage. At QNL we are delighted to see the prototype come into being,” said Sohair Wastawy, executive director at the Qatar National Library.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the launch, sample exhibits and case studies are being curated for the website, at <a href="https://dlme.clir.org/">https://dlme.clir.org/</a>. The first planned exhibits focus on Egyptian and Near Eastern female figurines, Qatar’s maritime history and heritage, and on how the DLME supports cultural heritage preservation. The case study recounts Egyptologist Jacco Dieleman’s discovery, made using the prototype, of papyrus fragments that had not been indexed in other papyrological resources, and illustrates the kind of discovery that the DLME hopes to reveal for users around the world.</p>
<p>The prototype builds on results from an earlier planning grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. For more information on the DLME, visit <a href="https://dlme.clir.org/">https://dlme.clir.org/</a>.</p>

<p><em>The Antiquities Coalition is a founding partner of the Digital Library of the Middle East (DLME). Working with the Washington, DC-based Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR), we are creating a federated resource of digitized cultural heritage materials from museums, libraries, archives, and other collections. The DLME will be accessible, interoperable, and open source and will include collections from around the world. In response to the urgent threat from cultural racketeers, the DLME will contribute to the security of Middle Eastern and North African heritage by mitigating looting and illicit sale through registration and improved tracking of objects’ provenance. Post-conflict, the DLME will be designed to increase global knowledge capacity by facilitating research, teaching, new forms of cultural expression, and fresh discovery.</em></p>
<p><em> </em><em>AC Co-founder Peter Herdrich is leading the DLME effort with Dr. Charles Henry, the President of CLIR. Peter outlined the progress the DLME has made in its first year. </em></p>

<h4>What can you tell us about the DLME?</h4>
<p>Last summer we got off to an auspicious start when we received a planning grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to assess the idea of creating the Digital Library of the Middle East. We assembled a terrific team – Bethany Nowviskie, the Director of the Digital Library Federation; Elizabeth Waraksa, Program Director for Research and Strategic Initiatives at the Association of Research Libraries; independent media producer Neil Sieling; and Wayne Graham, the Technical Director of CLIR and the Digital Library Federation have all made critical contributions. So have colleagues at CLIR and the Antiquities Coalition.</p>

<p>We wanted to verify that a large-scale digital library focused on the Middle East would be something that would be of interest to a wide variety users, what the technical challenges of building the library would be, how the DLME could help to combat looting and contribute to cultural heritage preservation, and how we could best partner with museums, libraries, archives, and government and private partners worldwide. The team reached out broadly and assembled the answers. And we were amazed with the results.</p>
<p>It’s never really wise to speak in absolutes when discussing opinion, but I think it’s safe to say that support for the Digital Library of the Middle East has been almost unanimous. What we heard was yes, the technology exists and can be deployed for this type of large scale digital library. Yes, users from advanced scholars to high school students are interested. Yes, this will make a significant contribution to the cultural record and to preservation. And yes, existing collections want to federate and become part of the effort. Challenges certainly exist, but nearly uniformly we heard endorsement for the idea, for its importance, and for its goals.</p>
<p>What was especially encouraging is that this response came from all constituents. It came from North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia; from museum, library, archival, manuscript, and archaeological collections; from law enforcement, diplomatic, government, and cultural heritage preservation officials; and from people who believe in the importance of the culture of the Middle East. In fact, as our investigations developed and more people heard about the project, a community of interest and commitment has began to form around the DLME.</p>
<p>It’s been a heart-warming response and we are taking the next steps. With the generous help of the Whiting Foundation, we have the funding to build a prototype digital platform for the DLME. We are going from vaporware to reality, as DLME TD Wayne Graham says. And our team is unrivalled. The Stanford University Libraries and its engineers have joined us as our principal technical partner on the DLME. The team is working right now on a platform that will allow us to federate, search, and exhibit digital materials from collections all over the world.</p>

<p><a href="https://theantiquitiescoalition.org/press-releases/clir-antiquities-coalition-initiative-partners-with-qatar-national-library/">Our team is also growing</a>. The Council on Library and Information Resources and the Qatar National Library just signed a Memorandum of Understanding for cooperation to develop, enhance, and make available digitized cultural heritage content through the Digital Library of the Middle East. This is an exciting and important step. For us to create a successful digital library, it is imperative that we work closely with partners throughout the MENA region. Collaboration with the QNL is an unparalleled step toward fulfilling our mission.</p>

<h4>How big do you see the DLME becoming?</h4>
<p>We believe that over the years the DLME will grow to millions of records. Scalability is an important issue. The more material with have in the library, the more we have to search and understand. We also have more records and more digital surrogates to use in case of theft and looting and more provenance records should questions of illicit trade arise.</p>
<h4>What are the next steps for the organization?</h4>
<p>We are in a second planning stage now, to determine how to best proceed. There are important questions to sort out. How do we build and maintain a robust and inclusive technical platform for the DLME? How do we support and engage with collections in the Middle East? How do we create a user experience that allows for the florescence of scholarship and search? What sort of administrative and organizational support do we need? How can we ensure financial sustainability for the project? It’s a big job.</p>
<h4>What do you see as the principal lessons learned so far?</h4>
<p>There is an urgent need for the Digital Library of the Middle East. As the Antiquities Coalition and its many supporters well know, our culture is under threat. And we need to continue to create solutions that address security, risk management, international cooperation, and a view of our shared cultural heritage that recognizes its universality and its incredible importance and potential in the region. The DLME addresses all these issues, by federating inventories and provenance records, by making accessible the cultural record of the Middle East, and by creating a worldwide cooperative community that believes that these are shared goals for all of us and are willing to help. That’s what we hear, that incredible positive reaction to the DLME. So it’s up to us – all of us – to make it work.</p>
